## Overview

Welcome to the **0x0A. C - argc, argv** repository! This project explores the concepts of `argc` and `argv` in the C programming language. The program receives command-line arguments and demonstrates their usage. This readme article provides an overview of the project and how to run and understand the code.

## Description

In C programming, `argc` and `argv` are important parameters used to handle command-line arguments. When running a C program from the command line, you can pass additional arguments to the program. `argc` (argument count) represents the number of arguments passed, and `argv` (argument vector) is a pointer to an array of strings containing the arguments themselves.

This project contains a C program that showcases how to use `argc` and `argv` to process command-line inputs effectively.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need the following:

- C Compiler: This project was developed and tested using a C compiler like GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).
- Operating System: The code should work on any operating system that supports C, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/0x0A-argc-argv.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd 0x0A-argc-argv
```

3. Compile the C files using your C compiler:

```
gcc -o argc_argv main.c
```

## Usage

To use the program, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the compiled executable file.

The program will take command-line arguments and process them accordingly. It demonstrates how to access each argument using the `argc` and `argv` parameters and perform specific actions based on the input.

Here's the syntax for running the program:

```
./argc_argv arg1 arg2 arg3 ...
```

Replace `argc_argv` with the name of the compiled executable and `arg1`, `arg2`, `arg3`, etc. with the command-line arguments you want to pass.

## Examples

1. **Basic Usage**

```
./argc_argv
```

Output: `Usage: ./argc_argv arg1 arg2 ...`

This example shows that the program requires at least one command-line argument.

2. **Providing Arguments**

```
./argc_argv Hello World 123
```

Output:
```
Argument 0: ./argc_argv
Argument 1: Hello
Argument 2: World
Argument 3: 123
```

This example demonstrates how the program processes multiple command-line arguments and prints each one.
